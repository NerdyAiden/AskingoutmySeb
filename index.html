        <div id="letter-box">Hi Sebbbbb haha. I know were just best friends currently, and bawal kapa talaga pumasok sa seryosong relationship but I still wanted to ask you honestly. Will you be my Valentines this coming February 14, 2026?. I know you dont really like Valentines Day because of some bad memories, and because its the birthday of the lola you hate, so I understand why the date is not something you look forward to. I know it can bring up things you would rather not think about, and I respect that. I am not trying to force the meaning of the day or make it a big deal. I just wanted to ask in my own simple way, becOur resentcent photo together ause you matter to me and I did not want to miss the chance to tell you that. I actually wanted to ask you when i surprised you with flowers nun i forgot lang hehe sorr, i wantOur baby pics:3 you to forget everything and make the day special for you ^-^ i want you to be happyyyyyyyyyyyy so happy. aaaaa this is my first time doing this so pls be nice to me hehe.
 I also want to use this opportunity to tell you that wala akong ibang gusto, kundi ikaw lang seb.</div>
